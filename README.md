# wazeForHealthcare
This projects aims to revolutionize healthcare systems (HCS).

Currently, there are some annoying paradoxes in HCS: 
  1. patients only "exist" to HCS when they are ill and seek for medical/hospital attention;
  2. patient are the only one who do not have prompt access to their own data, which is under custody of many services/institutionsthemselves
  3. data is fragmented and no institution is willing to share it, preventing benchmarking, potential financial or outcome comparisons (profitability, success rate)

Since I have a fairly good expertise on HCS and zero on coding, I would like to invite crazy minds to join this movement, which aims to deliver the "waze" for HCS.

Would it not be a pleasure to know that big companies (such as Amazon, Apple, IBM) could not reach this goal, and we, as a community, could pull it off?

Some founding pillars for the app/produtct:
1. patient must be the ones holding their data on their mobile devices (and cloud-based?)
2. patient history does not change, it alwasy keep growing, as new conditions stack on top of the old ones. we could think on an avatar with color code to represent previous surgeries, chronic diseases, traumas, etc
3. Gamification would entice patients to feed their own medical record - so the concept of recognition would be key
4. Easy or comprehensive user interface/experience would help a lot (data visualization concepts, for instance)
5. Upon a medical appointment or hospital admission, patient will allow third parties to access their medical record
6. After the consultation patients can endorse what physicians fed into their medical record

Main reasons to join the project:
1. Legacy
2. Technology serving humankind, not the other way around
3. Real world data (RWD) or real world evidence (RWE) clinical studies could compare results in real life vs results published on medical journals
4. This is a multi-billion-dollar-worth project, so profitability will not be an issue
5. Every contributor will have their share on the success

Any ideas, insights or concerns? Let us have 1:1 conversation, please let me know privately.

Thanks for reading this out.
